                Big dreaming, it is something I have acknowledged from my late beloved father. He thought me how to
                dream, what dream means and what it will bring if I run for it. During short life-span of mine I have
                had quite a <strong>drastical</strong> few ups and downs. In those time, he told me supported me to
                continue and try for the next with the best. Now still I fail myself, but I wish and try to not to do
                the same mistake the second time.<br>

                    It's a my old journey of learning, I have started this journey quite a while ago. I have not seen
                    any outcome from my journey. I have understood lately that I am not good at bringing conclusion to
                    things. Which is also visible in some of my practical course and learning. Lately I have understood
                    a few of my lackings and now I am a 100% dedicated person to do anything except those past mistakes
                    to improve my learnings and everything. :) Insha'Allah
